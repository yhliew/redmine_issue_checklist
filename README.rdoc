== Test
rake test:plugins PLUGIN=redmine_issue_checklist RAILS_ENV=test_sqlite3

== What's modified
This is a fork of the plugin from http://redminecrm.com/projects/checklist/wiki version 1.0.3.
I modified the plugin for it to allow duplication of checklist on issue duplication, based on changes in http://github.com/belike81/Redmine-Issue-Checklist-Plugin
